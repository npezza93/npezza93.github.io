      Archipelago is an open-source terminal emulator built on <a href="https://www.google.com/search">Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">JavaScript</a>, <a href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev">Stimulus.js</a>, and utilizes <a href="https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js">Xterm.js</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a fan of web technologies, so I started using <a href="https://github.com/zeit/hyper">Hyper</a> as my default terminal while it was in beta. Hyper was by far the coolest, best looking, and extensible terminal emulator I had used.
    </p>

    <p>But, I found Hyper(beta and version 1) to be extremely slow, to the point that if I was going to run a command that I knew would have a lot of output, I would opt for using an alternative. Along with that, occasionally buffers would overlap making the terminal unreadable and force me to restart the terminal.</p>

    <p>After using Hyper for a while and then finding the <a href="https://xtermjs.org/">Xterm.js</a> project(Hyper was using <a href="https://github.com/chromium/hterm">hterm</a> at this point, it has since switched to Xterm.js as of v2), I thought perhaps I can make a terminal that performs faster than Hyper. So that's what Archipelago is, my perfect terminal, fast, pretty, simple, and stable.</p>
