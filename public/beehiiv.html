    <ul>
      <li>Improved the subscriber database by restructuring how custom subscriber data is stored, enabling publishers to more easily organize and segment audiences based on attributes like dates, numbers, text, booleans, and lists. This allowed for advanced subscriber targeting and significantly reduced query times.</li>
      <li>Rebuilt our embeddable subscription form as a themeable, field-extensible component, letting publishers match brand styles and collect custom fields at signup (e.g., first name).</li>
      <li>Modernized the ad network section for publishers with glanceable summary cards, sortable tables, and drill-downs so publishers can quickly assess earnings and ad opportunities.</li>
