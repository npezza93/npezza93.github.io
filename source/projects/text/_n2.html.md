N2 Publishing produces neighborhood print publications that create a sense of community and support local businesses.

-   Integral maintainer of a client order entry and payment application that was built using Ruby on Rails by creating tested features and reviewing peers code in an Agile environment. Some of the features I created include re-architecting how N2's commissions were determined, scoping the application to handle different publication products with separate commission rules and production schedules, and updating the old API for payment processing.
-   Developed features for a new publication management system, that utilizes Ruby on Rails, which tracks publications' design status, assists communication between clients and ad designers, and helps increase productivity and decrease costs.
-   Rebuilt and deployed the entire public facing website (n2pub.com) in less than one month using design mock-ups and Ruby on Rails.
-   In conjunction with our user experience designer, created and maintain a front-end style guide Ruby gem to document and centralize the design language throughout all of N2â€™s applications (https://n2publishing.github.io/n2-styles). Some of the other Ruby gems I maintain at N2 include a REST API for Absorb's Learning Management System and Single Sign-On/Logoff for our distributed system.
-   Completed a year-long in-house leadership training.
